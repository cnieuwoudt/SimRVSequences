\describe{
  \item{chrom}{Numeric. The chromosome number.}
  \item{exonStart}{Numeric. The exon's starting position, in base pairs.}
  \item{exonStop}{Numeric. The exon's ending position, in base pairs.}

\description{
This data set catalouges the positions, in base pairs, of the exons residing on human chromosomes 1-22.  The positions of the exons were obtained from the UCSC Genome Broswer, from the  using the NCBI RefSeq curated exons.  In this dataset we have combined overlapping exons into a single entry.
